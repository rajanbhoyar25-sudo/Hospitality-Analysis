# Hospitality-Analysis
A Hospitality Analysis dashboard is a virtul tool used to centralize and visualize critical business data in real time, empowering managers to make immediate, data-driven decisions.
Its primary purpose is to quickly answer key performance questions about occupancy rates, revenue, and guest satisfaction without needing to manually sift through disparate reports. By monitoring KPIs at a glance, operators can enhance operational efficiency, optimize pricing strategies, and proactively address problems to maximize profitability and improve the overall guest experience.
